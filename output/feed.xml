                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rochester Public Schools (RPS) is asking voters to approve a Capital Projects Technology Levy Referendum in this fall’s election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The referendum is a ballot question asking voters to approve a $10 million/year funding increase, financed by property taxes for homeowners and businesses in the district.</span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strengthen cyber-security to prevent future attacks and safeguard personal information and sensitive data for everyone involved in the district</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provide a dedicated source of funding for technology needs, which would enable reallocation of $7 million of the District’s General Fund for teaching, curriculum, mental health services, and other opportunities for students</span></li>

                    <p>Rochester Public Schools have the potential to be world-class. But limited resources are holding us back.</p>
<p>The district is going through a painful 3-year process of budget cuts in order to be financially sustainable. $20 million has been cut, and by next year the total will be between $25-30 million. As parents, educators, and community members, we're worried about this. We need more resources for our kids' learning, not fewer. </p>
<p>The new revenue raised through this referendum is a needed, strategic investment in technology to keep our kids safe, support their learning, and make school operations more efficient. Importantly, having $10 million in dedicated revenue for technology annually would free up $7 million in general funds to be used to advance schools’ learning mission in other ways, like retaining educators and lowering class sizes.</p>
<p>RPS has an ambitious strategic plan to meet educational gaps between students and become recognized as a top-tier school district. Changes made are showing early signs of success: graduation rates went up 2.1% ­— ten times the rate of Minnesota overall. The improvement was the greatest among students of color, low-income students, and students with disabilities.</p>
<p>Our students are on the right track. Now, they need us to deliver the resources to keep the momentum going. <strong>Vote YES on or before November 7 to accelerate learning for all our kids.</strong></p>
