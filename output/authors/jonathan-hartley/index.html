But limited resources are holding us back.</p><p>The district is going through a painful 3-year process of budget cuts in order to be financially sustainable. $20 million has been cut, and by next year the total will be between $25-30 million. As parents, educators, and community members, we're worried about this. We need more resources for our kids' learning, not fewer. </p><p>The new revenue raised through this referendum is a needed, strategic investment in technology to keep our kids safe, support their learning, and make school operations more efficient. Importantly, having $10 million in dedicated revenue for technology annually would free up $7 million in general funds to be used to advance schools’ learning mission in other ways, like retaining educators and lowering class sizes.</p><p>RPS has an ambitious strategic plan to meet educational gaps between students and become recognized as a top-tier school district. Changes made are showing early signs of success: graduation rates went up 2.1% ­— ten times the rate of Minnesota overall. The improvement was the greatest among students of color, low-income students, and students with disabilities.</p><p>Our students are on the right track. Now, they need us to deliver the resources to keep the momentum going. <strong>Vote YES on or before November 7 to accelerate learning for all our kids.</strong></p><a href="https://tartley.github.io/vote-yes-for-school-tech/why-should-i-vote-yes.html" class="readmore feed__readmore">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2023-08-29T16:56" class="feed__date">August 29, 2023</time></div><h2><a href="https://tartley.github.io/vote-yes-for-school-tech/why-now.html">Why Now?</a></h2></header><div class="wrapper"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past two decades, per pupil funding for public education has not kept pace with inflation.
