# Publii Source for https://voteyesforschooltechrochester.org

This repo forms a directory under ~/Publii/sites.

ie. for me on Linux, I ran Publii, used it to create a new blank site,
which it saved into:

    ~/Publii/sites/vote-yes-for-school-tech

And then from within that directory, I remove any junk from the blank
site and clone this repo with:

    git clone git@github.com:tartley/vote-yes-for-school-tech-source.git .

(Note the `.` on the end)
